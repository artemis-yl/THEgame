PLEASE GO INTO THE CHROME-A FOLDER FOR THE 'FINAL' GAME. The "outer" files are simply the prototype we used/made when learning how to use Godot.

This game was made by me (Artemis Yulim Lee), Serena and Aimee!

Aimee: 2D Artist! Concept, texture, logo and all backgrounds! Why it looks actually pretty!!!!!
Serena: 3D Artist, Animator and Asset Maker!!! You see anything 3D, Serena made it! Our player animation is all her hard work!
Artemis: Coder and Game Developer! All scripts and overall structure/scene creation was created by Artemis.
