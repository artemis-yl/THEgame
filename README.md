PLEASE GO INTO THE CHROME-A FOLDER FOR THE 'FINAL' GAME. The "outer" files are simply the prototype we used/made when learning how to use Godot.

This game was made by Artemis, Serena and Aimee!


Aimee: 2D Artist! Concept, texture, logo and all backgrounds! Why it looks actually pretty!!!!!

Serena: 3D Artist, Animator and Asset Maker!!! You see anything 3D, Serena made it! Our player animation is all her hard work!

Artemis: Coder and Game Developer! All scripts and overall structure/scene creation was created by Artemis.


Please note, we never made a game before and are entry-level coders! Making all the art, assets, and learning how to use a whole game engine in just under a week!!! Let's be proud of ourselves.
