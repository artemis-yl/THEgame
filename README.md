### PLEASE GO INTO THE CHROME-A FOLDER FOR THE 'FINAL' GAME. The "outer" files are simply the prototype we used/made when learning how to use Godot.

This game is a 2.5D platformer made on the Godot 3.5 game engine! Here, you are a robot who has just woken up in the ruins of humanity. Somehow, you have  woken up even thought you should be in pieces, and some strange flower is powering you. Perhaps by spreading its influence you can do something about wastelands before you.




## Credits:

This game was made by Artemis, Serena and Aimee!

**Do note that my teammates have asked to only have their first names published here on GitHub. If you would like to contact them for their amazing art skills, you can likley find them through TMU's Game Maker Union.**

Aimee: 2D Artist! Concept, texture, logo and all backgrounds! Why it looks actually pretty!!!!!

Serena: 3D Artist, Animator and Asset Maker!!! You see anything 3D, Serena made it! Our player animation is all her hard work!

Artemis: Coder, Game Developer, Repo Owner! All scripts and overall game structure/scene creation was created by Artemis. The simple textboxes, weird boxes and flowers models for the puzzle was also created by them.


Please note, we never made a game before and are entry-level coders! Making all the art, assets, and learning how to use a whole game engine in just under a week!!! Let's be proud in how much we have done.


## When:

LibreGameFest was held through 2023, Sept. 22nd 6pm - 29th 6pm.

## Other Details:

We created this game through Godot 3.5. The vast majority of the 3D assets and animations were created on Blender. Code was done through Godot's native script, which I will state is near identicle to Python (at least, the portions I, Artemis, used were).

## Reflections:

As a team, we noted that we were quite ambitious in our initial game design:
- various rooms that each could be unlocked to progress
- more complicated puzzles that tied into the idea of renewing the acopolytic world.
- ideally more completed 3D models

Of course, we knew since we had no previous experience we likely would only be able to make one demo level.

In hindsight, we should have stuck to making a 2D game, since it is both simpler and as Godot 3.5's 3D game making abilities are frankly less polished than for 2D.
